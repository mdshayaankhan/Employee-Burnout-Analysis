### **GitHub Repository Description**  

**Employee Burnout Analysis**  

This project focuses on predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing attributes such as Employee ID, Date of Joining, Gender, Company Type, WFH Setup Availability, Designation, Resource Allocation, Mental Fatigue Score, and Burn Rate, the analysis identifies key factors contributing to burnout and builds predictive models for estimation.  

#### **Features of the Project**:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the dataset with visualizations and correlation analysis.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features for model training.  
- **Model Development**: Implement Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors models to predict the Burn Rate.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2 to assess model performance.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the KNN model with GridSearchCV to enhance accuracy.  
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify key predictors of employee burnout to assist in HR decision-making.  

#### **Technologies Used**:  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning and Model Tuning)  
- Google Colab (Development Environment)  

#### **How to Use**:  
1. Clone the repository and upload the dataset in the required format.  
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook/Colab script to preprocess the data and train models.  
3. Evaluate the models and interpret the predictions.  

This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding and addressing employee burnout, offering valuable insights for organizational well-being.
